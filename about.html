<h2 class="section-heading">Being fast and efficient</h2>

<p>We are two engineers with combined 40+ years of experience in the field of particle accelerators. This unique experience we have bundled in the design of a state of the art control system (<a href="https://blinky-lite.org/docs/">Blinky-Lite</a>) which satisfied our needs and supports us in our <b>mission</b> to work highly efficient.</p>

<p>We use this full-stack control system now to develop dedicated solutions for our customers, either to integrate sophisticated particle accelerating structures or for any supporting systems thereof (e.g. leak detection systems, etc).</p>

<p>Due to its full-stack nature, every system we build can fully live on its own or can be in exchange with an existing control system through a RESTful API interface.</p>

<p>We start at the sensor, design two layered PCB electronic hardware interfaces where necessary and provide the fully integrated system to our customers via a dedicated web aplication that is securely accessible through two factor authentification (2FA).</p>

<p>Utilising secure, wireless communication technology, Blinky-Lite also enables us to add systems to already existing facility installations without the need to pull new control cables.</p>

<p>Installations at our customers around the globe have proven to be highly reliable over the years and meanwhile we can refer to installations at renowned research facilities in Sweden (<a href="https://www.maxiv.lu.se/">MAX IV</a>), the US (<a href="https://www.fnal.gov/">Fermilab</a>) and in Hungary (<a href="https://mirrotron.com/en">Mirrotron</a>). Live system examples thereof can be found at this <a href="https://blinky-lite.org/system-examples/">link</a>.</p>

<p>Since the construction of particle accelerators is already a challenging endeavour due to the manufacturing complexity of very demanding components, our <b>vision</b> is to accelerate the commercialization of (compact) particle accelerators through fully integrated, ready to go subsystems.</p>
